# MyFitnessPal Weight Exporter

Script I wrote which outputs a CSV containing all the weight measurements that were logged on a MyFitnessPal account.

## Installation and Development

Clone the repo, run `npm install`, add a `config.json` containing the username and password of the account, then run `npm start` to start the script.
